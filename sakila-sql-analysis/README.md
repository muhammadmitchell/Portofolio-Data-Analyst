# üé¨ Sakila SQL Analysis

This project aims to analyze the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/), a DVD rental store database often used for SQL training. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, film inventory, sales and rental patterns using structured queries.

## üìÅ File Included
- [latihan.sql](https://github.com/muhammadmitchell/Portofolio-Data-Analyst/blob/2a113919aa65bb227bc0cd893b91fc9b662c2b7a/sakila-sql-analysis/latihan.sql) ‚Äî contains multiple queries to explore and analyze data in the Sakila database.

## üß† Key Topics Practiced
- Filtering data with `WHERE` and `LIKE`
- Work with `AND` / `OR` / `IN` operators
- Aggregation using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`
- Table joins (`INNER JOIN`) between `customer`, `rental`, `film`, `category`, etc.
- Using functions like `DATE()`, `CONCAT()`
- Sorting and limiting results
- Creating `Common Table Expressions (CTE)`
- Business Analysis and Decision Making with SQL

## üìä Example Questions Answered
- What are the most rented movies?
- How many rentals we do on each day?
- Which day had the most rentals?
- How many distinct customer last names are there?
- Who rented movies on July 26th, 2005?
- Which films fall under the Sci-fi category?
- All films that have deleted scenes
- Which movies are not returned yet?

## üß∞ Tools Used
- MySQL / BigQuery
- Sakila sample database
- Excel for Visualizations
